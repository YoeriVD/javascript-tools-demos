In this lab you will learn about npm scripting.
So far we have used npm to install tools usefull for development. We will now define our own tasks so it's easier to run them multiple times.

**1) let's start with creating a task for wiredep. Open package.json

**2) add a 'scripts' property so that the file looks like this:

{
  "name": "demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "scripts": {
  },
  "author": "Yoeri Van Damme",
  "dependencies": {
    "wiredep": "^3.0.0"
  }
}


**3) in this scripts object, we can define our own tasks. The key will be the name of the task and the value the command to execute.
     Add the following task to launch wiredep:

"scripts": {
    "wiredep" : "node wiredep.js"
  },

**4) run the command in your command prompt by using the following syntax:

npm run [name-of-task]
so in our case:
npm run wiredep

    Use this task in the future to update the files should it be necessary.

**5) install http-server by running
npm install http-server --save-dev

**6) add the following task to the npm scripts object:
"start": "http-server"

     This task is one of the 2 "special" tasks in npm. They are predefined and thus you don't need to use "npm run " to start them. You can just call "npm start" to execute this.
     The other task is "install".

**7) enter "npm start" in the command prompt and go http://127.0.0.1:8080 with a browser. Your website should be visible


**8) we can automate even further by calling the wiredep task AND the typescript compiler before we start the application. First modify tsconfig.json and disable the watch:
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "amd",
        "target": "es5",
        "watch": false,
        "outDir": "dist"
    }   
}

**9) add the following script task in package.json:
"prestart": "ntsc && npm run wiredep"

This task will run 'pre' the start task. If you want to, you can also define a 'poststart' task. The 'pre' and 'post' prefixes are a convention and will work for every task defined.





**8) let's make sure that wiredep is run everytime we start our application
