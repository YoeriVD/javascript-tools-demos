In this lab we will be using WebPack. A nice tool that offers us a few cool features.

*****
NOTE: I needed to add the following import in index.module.ts to make sure my editor would still work with angular: 
import * as angular from 'angular';
*****


**1) start by copying the previous lab in a new folder

**2) uninstall system.js
bower uninstall system.js --save

**3) open tsconfig.json and change "system" to "commonjs"

**3) install the following dependencies with npm
npm install typescript --save
npm install awesome-typescript-loader --save
npm install webpack --save
npm install webpack-dev-server --save

**4) add the following scripts to package.json. These scripts will help us start webpack.
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --progress --colors",
    "watch": "webpack --progress --colors --watch",
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --progress --colors"
  },

**5) almost there, now create the settings for webpack. Add a file webpack.config.js in the root folder with the following
module.exports = {
    entry: './app/index.module.ts',
    output: {
        filename: './app/bundle.js'
    },
    resolve: {
        extensions: ['', '.webpack.js', '.web.js', '.ts', '.js']
    },
    module: {
        loaders: [
            { test: /\.ts$/, loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader' }
        ]
    }
}
	This config does the following:
		- specify to bundle it in one file called 'bundle.js'
		- which extensions to take into account
		- which 'loader' webpack should use to read our files. this loader will be used to 'read' the input. In our case it will compile the typescript files.

**6) now add a script tag in index.html that will load the generated bundle. You can remove all the comments for bower and replace the head tag with:
<head>
    <script src="app/bundle.js" async></script>
</head>

**7) try the commands we defined in a shell:
npm run build --> this will build the application
npm start     --> this will build the application, launch a development server and watch for changes. all in one tool!

**8) study the bundle.js file. You will see that everything is included. The webpack framework, angularjs and our own code.
