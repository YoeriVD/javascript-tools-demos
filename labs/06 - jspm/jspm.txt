As always, copy the previous lab in a new folder
We will now learn about another tool called JSPM. This tool is pretty popular as it offers
a wide solution. No need for bower, system.js, or webpack.

**1) remove the webpack config

**2) replace the package.json file with this:
{
  "name": "demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "scripts": {
    "prestart": "npm run bundle",
    "start": "http-server",
    "prebundle": "tsc",
    "bundle": "jspm bundle app/index.module --inject"
  },
  "author": "Yoeri Van Damme",
  "dependencies": {
    "http-server": "^0.8.5",
    "jspm": "^0.16.19"
  }
}


**3) run npm install

**4) we will now initialize jspm by running 'jspm init'
	it will ask us several questions, reply as follows:
	- prefix? yes
	- baseUrl? just press enter
	- jspm package folder? just press enter
	- config path? jspm.config.js
	- create? yes
	- client baseUrl? yes
	- transpiler? NO (we will compile our javascript ourselves)

**5) install angular by
jspm install angular

**6) If we want to launch our application we could manually execute
tsc
jspm bundle app/index.module --inject
    
    or.. we can use our npm script tasks:
npm start
    this will execute the prestart first (bundle the code) and then run a server.
